LotteryGame is an educational game based on the Ethereum network. This game is running over the Rinkeby Test Network in order you can play with it without needing pay real money.

The LotteryGame's rules are very simple:

- A player defines an amount per player, and a count of minimum players, and creates a lottery.
- The rest of players can participate in any lottery they want paying the amount per player defined in it.
- Once the lottery reaches out the minimum players, the manager (or creator) will be able to pick up a winner randomly.

## Important Notes

The process to pick up a winner randomly in the lottery is only for educational purposes. We do <strong>NOT advice</strong> to implement it in a production environment. It could be easily hacked by a malicious player.
